Configuration Management:-
--------------------------
This is a process of configuring remote servers from one point of control

Advantages:-
-------------
Provisioning of Servers:-
------------------------
Installations of different softwares on a server or upgradation of existing softwares or deleting of
softwares can be done very easily from one point of control.

Creation of Replica Environments:-
-----------------------------------
configurartion managements tools have the capability of capturing the setup information of the remote 
servers.this setup information can be used for creating similar environments in a different datacentre.

Idempotent:-
-------------
configuration management tools are used to bring the servers to a particular state which is called as
a desired state. if a remote server is already in the desired state then configuration management tools
will not reconfigure that server.

Handling Snowflake Servers:-
------------------------------
over a period of time each server present in a data centre will behave like a snowflake.i.e it might 
have slightly different hardware and software configurations.configuration management tools can 
capture that information using which we can create similar environments.

Ansible:-
---------
ansible is a open source configuration managment tool created using python.the main machine where 
ansible is installed is called as controller.the remote servers that we tried to configure are called
as managed nodes or managed hosts.ansible uses agentless policy i.e there is no necessity for 
installing any software on the managed nodes.only passwordless ssh should be installed between 
controller and managed nodes.
ansible performs a necessary configurations using push protocol.i.e it is simply pushes the necessary
config changes through passwordless ssh.
